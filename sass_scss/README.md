# SASS and SCSS

- SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) and SCSS (Sassy CSS) are extensions of CSS that provide some additional features and functionalities.

- SASS was developed by Hampton Catlin in 2006.

- SASS allows for the use of variables

- Nesting of CSS rules

- Inheritance allows selectors to inherit the styles of another

- Functions can be used to manipulate values and perform calculations

- SCSS retains CSS syntax and inherits the features of SASS. Because of its CSS-like syntax SCSS gained wider adoption in the web development community. Existing CSS code can easily be integrated into SCSS files.
