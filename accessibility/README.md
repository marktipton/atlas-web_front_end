# Accessibility

- WCAG is a set of rules created by the W3C to make digital content more accessible for all users.

- WCAG follows 4 basic principles that follow the acronym POUR:
  - Perceivable: Users can perceive content (not necessarily by sight but perhaps by other senses)
  - Operable: Users can use UI components of the content and navigate through the content
  - Understandable: Users understand the content and interface
  - Robust: Content can be consumed by a wide variety of users and it works with assistive technology
